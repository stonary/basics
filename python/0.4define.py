'''Important warning: The default value is evaluated only once. 
   This makes a difference when the default is a mutable object 
   such as a list, dictionary, or instances of most classes. 
   For example, the following function accumulates the arguments
   passed to it on subsequent calls:
'''

def f(a, L=[]):
    L.append(a)
    return L

print f(1)
print f(2)
print f(3)

'''This will print

[1]
[1, 2]
[1, 2, 3]

If you don¡¯t want the default to be shared between subsequent calls,
you can write the function like this instead:

'''

def f(a, L=None):
    if L is None:
        L = []
    L.append(a)
    return L
    

'''
When a final formal parameter of the form **name is present, it receives a 
dictionary (see Mapping Types ¡ª dict) containing all keyword arguments except 
for those corresponding to a formal parameter. This may be combined with a 
formal parameter of the form *name (described in the next subsection) which 
receives a tuple containing the positional arguments beyond the formal parameter
list. (*name must occur before **name.) For example, if we define a function 
like this:
'''

def cheeseshop(kind, *arguments, **keywords):
    print "-- Do you have any", kind, "?"
    print "-- I'm sorry, we're all out of", kind
    for arg in arguments:
        print arg
    print "-" * 40
    keys = sorted(keywords.keys())
    for kw in keys:
        print kw, ":", keywords[kw]

'''
It could be called like this:
'''

cheeseshop("Limburger", "It's very runny, sir.",
           "It's really very, VERY runny, sir.",
           shopkeeper='Michael Palin',
           client="John Cleese",
           sketch="Cheese Shop Sketch")

'''
and of course it would print:
'''

#-- Do you have any Limburger ?
#-- I'm sorry, we're all out of Limburger
#It's very runny, sir.
#It's really very, VERY runny, sir.
#----------------------------------------
#client : John Cleese
#shopkeeper : Michael Palin
#sketch : Cheese Shop Sketch

'''
Note that the list of keyword argument names is created by sorting the result 
of the keywords dictionary¡¯s keys() method before printing its contents; if 
this is not done, the order in which the arguments are printed is undefined.
